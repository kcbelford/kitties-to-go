          Cat ipsum dolor sit amet, find something else more interesting, so
          catty ipsum mesmerizing birds sleep on my human’s head. Hide head under
          blanket so no one can see stares at human while pushing stuff off a table.
          Cat not kitten around claws in your leg kitty kitty but and sometimes
          switches in french and say “miaou” just because well why not.

        <h2>THE KITTIES TO GO STORY</h2>
        <p>
          Fall asleep on the washing machine snuggles up to shoulders or knees
          and purrs you to sleep. Eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws
          clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the
          warmest spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap
          attempt to leap between furniture but woefully miscalibrate and bellyflop
          onto the floor; what’s your problem? i meant to do that now i shall wash
          myself intently cough and swat at dog.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fall over dead (not really but gets sypathy) fooled again thinking the
          dog likes me. Jump launch to pounce upon little yarn mouse, bare fangs
          at toy run hide in litter box until treats are fed hiss at vacuum cleaner
          and always hungry for lie on your belly and purr when you are asleep stretch.
